# A Probabilistic Framework for Temporal Distribution Generalization in Industry-Scale Recommender Systems

This repository is the official implementation of our paper [A Probabilistic Framework for Temporal Distribution Generalization in Industry-Scale Recommender Systems]().
In this work we propose ELBO_TDS, a probabilistic self-supervised framework to address the temporal distribution shift in industry-scale recommender systems.
